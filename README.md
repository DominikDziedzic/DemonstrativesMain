### Import data
Download raw data: "TODO:Name" in [.txt](https://www.google.com/) or [.csv format](https://www.google.com/) and run the following in R to import the data: 

``` r
# a) if in .txt:
data <- read.delim(file.choose())
# b) if in .csv:
data <- read.csv(file.choose(), sep = ";")
```
Note: the raw data in .txt and .csv files were first exported from an online survey platform and saved as a [.xlsx file named “data – Export Only Completed”](); that is, with export “only completed responses” option enabled. To view the full dataset, i.e., the one with uncompleted responses, open [data – Export All.xlsx]().
